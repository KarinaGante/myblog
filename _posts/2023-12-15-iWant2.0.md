# iWant 2.0

<p style="text-align: justify;">
iWant 2.0 is an assistive communication tool designed specifically to support individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Developed as part of a university capstone project, the app was created using Thunkable, a block-based programming platform that enables the development of customized, interactive mobile applications to facilitate non-verbal communication and promote digital inclusion for autistic individuals.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This innovative assistive technology project was officially accepted, published, and presented at the 14th Innovation, Science and Technology Congress (CONICT), one of the most prominent academic events in the field. Additionally, iWant 2.0 was featured at IFCIÊNCIA — the Science, Technology, and Entrepreneurship Fair held in Salto — further validating its relevance as a valuable initiative for accessibility and inclusive education.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
iWant 2.0 combines inclusive design, technological innovation, and educational purpose to develop accessible digital tools tailored to the unique communication needs of people with autism. It stands as a powerful example of how technology can enhance quality of life, autonomy, and participation in both educational and social environments.
